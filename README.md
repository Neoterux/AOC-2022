# Advent-Of-Code 2022

This repository doesn't want to become a competition only for fun,
and with the challenges that the time let me complete.

My personal challenge is to ty to complete the most of the challenges using
low level languages, fight with them and understand better the problem with
the POV of the capabilities of the used language.

## Target language to complete

I mostly love using C, so basically all my solutions migth be written on C.
Hopefully I'll try to learn something new like Carbon, Zig, Rust or C++.

But the main language would be C.
